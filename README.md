Three deep learning architectures were implemented and compared:

1.MobileNet + BiLSTM: A lightweight, efficient combination of a pre-trained CNN and a bidirectional LSTM for temporal pattern learning.
2.VGG16 + LSTM: A classical CNN architecture for spatial feature extraction followed by LSTM for sequence modeling.
3.Vision Transformer (ViT): A transformer-based model capturing both spatial and temporal relationships using attention mechanisms.
